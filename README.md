![screenshot](doc/figs/map2.png)

Until today, the pandemic has been lasted around 2 years. During this period, how people's life were changed? Would the pandemic affect people's decision about operating business heavily? 
In this project, we develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visulization* shiny app on the [License Application](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/License-Applications/ptev-4hud) dataset released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. From the applications of DCA Licenses, we can explore the number of newly invested business and the ones returned in NYC. In more depth, we can also explore the situations of each category and different business types. By combining data from license application and the pandemic Covid-19, we further investigate how the pandemic affects business applications and operations.

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

However, as time elapsed, people have experienced several Covid-19 outbreaks and maybe have been used to it that people's passion about business has returned.
